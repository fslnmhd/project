                    <p>NFGTA Collage Of Engineering is a welcoming collage for people of all backgrounds, regardless of age. It is centrally located, and easy to walk around. 
                        There is a lake near by, as well as a stream running right behind the dorms. They are currently updating the dorms, making them more inviting and livable for students.
                        Overall I love my Collage, and it works for me.</p>

                    <p>I love it! There are more online classes being added, so I can continue my education even from my home and office! They added Spanish, French and Kanji this semester,
                        so I took all three! Some of the teachers here are difficult to work with- always check Rate My Professor first! However, most of the teachers have been some of the kindest, 
                        intellectually stimulating and inspiring people that I have had the pleasure to learn with.</p>
